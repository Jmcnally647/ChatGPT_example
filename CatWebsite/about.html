    <h2>About Cats for Adoption</h2>
    <p>This website was generated in about 20 seconds with a few commands given to ChatGPT. I left the orginal descirptive text below as an example of the starting text when the page is created. Please note this is not a 
	real organization and is only used as a demonstration of what ChatGPT can do. This is also why famous cartoon cats were used as an example for this site.</p>
	<p> Here is the link for the script that was generated with ChatGPT: <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/544b7cce-6d51-48c7-9a44-62d3bd5182e9">ChatGPT example</a></p>
	<p>Cats for Adoption is a non-profit organization dedicated to finding loving homes for cats in need.</p>
